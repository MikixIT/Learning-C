# Learning-C


a playground to learn C and understand the machine
```

## 🧪 What Happens Here
A personal playground to learn C step by step.  
You compile, you break things, you rebuild.  
You experiment without fear and discover how computers really think.  
This repo exists to help me learn C in the most fun, chaotic and visual way possible.

## 🧠 Goals
- Understand how C really works  
- Learn how memory behaves: pointers, stack, heap  
- Make mistakes, read them, laugh, improve  
- Become a stronger frontend developer by understanding the low-level world  
- Lose the fear of “low-level” programming  

## 🧰 Tools I Use
- **CLion** (with terminal shortcut ready)  
- **GCC / Clang** as my battle arena  
- The terminal as my dojo  
- Coffee, always

┌───────────────────── ritual.sh ──────────────────────┐
│ $ gcc main.c -o main                                  │
│ main.c:42: warning: learning intensifies              │
│                                                       │

│ >> memory: may or may not explode                     │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🐉 Topics I Will Explore
- Pointers that don’t want to cooperate  
- Arrays that start at zero and judge you  
- Functions that return whatever you command  
- Memory management that requires zen focus  
- The preprocessor, chaotic entity of C  

```text
┌───────────── MEMORY MAP ─────────────┐
│ 0x0000  | area sicura (forse)        │
│ 0x0040  | variabili sperimentali     │
│ 0x00A0  | puntatore sospetto          │
│ 0x00FF  | free() dimenticato          │
│ 0x0BAD  | undefined behavior zone     │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🧭 Roadmap
- Hello World, but cooler  
- Variables and basic types  
- Loops and control flow  
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic  
- Structs and data organization  
- Advanced functions  
- Memory management  
- Small C projects  

## 🔥 Philosophy
Learn C without taking it too seriously  
Accept that mistakes are part of the journey  
Become a more complete developer by learning the low-level foundations  

## 🚀 Final Words  

```text
              /\    
    all hail /  \   the compiler
           / ⚙️  \   
          /______\  
     may your warnings be kind  
   and your segfaults educational
```

Welcome to my journey into C.  
This repo is my space to grow as a developer and understand what truly happens under the hood.
